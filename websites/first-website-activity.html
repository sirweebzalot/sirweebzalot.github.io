      <h2> INTRODUCTION </h2>
      <p> Hi there! My name is Alvin Cedric Villanueva, and I just entered adulthood at the age of 18 this last November. During these past two~ years this pandemic, I have been at my most active on the computer compared to the previous parts of my life. Currently, I am living my life as a 'busy' college freshman.</p>
      <p> It has been both 'blessing' and a 'curse' for me, hence the inception of the title, because, in short, I wanted to do everything online back when I was around high school. I remember thinking about if schools could make attending classes remote and being able to pass my assignments via online platforms like <i>Google Classroom &copy;</i>. But when I actually experienced it for the first time, <strong>it wasn't that great...</strong></p>
      <h2 class="yellow-line" style="color: #ffff00;"> __</h2>
      <h2> THE GOOD </h2>
      <h3> @ Home </h3>
      <p> I, for the most part, enjoy doing things alone, and I think most of my hobbies include just myself or with a couple of close friends or family. If you're like me, then you're probably an introvert. Being one means that I am physcically and mentally less capable compared to extroverts when I am outside or with other people I'm not really close to. If you don't catch my drift, well, it takes one to know one. WIth the situation we have right now, staying at home feels like a change of pace for me, and more of a positive one at that. I get to live this solitary lifestyle, where I can play computer games, read different reading materials (i.e. e-books, books, manga etc.), watch my favorite shows, browsing memes and stuff on the internet, talk with friends online, etc. Lastly, I also feel like I have more opportunity to be with my family than ever before</p>

      <h3> New Hobbies & Skills </h3>
      <p> I tried to make the most of my time, because I rarely get to get this much time inside my home. I have a lot of interests and most of them I did practice and hone, and only some of them I actually dropped because I'm not that driven to learn it. One such example of a skill that I tried to really get into was drawing and sketching. I tried to improve as much as I can and implement practice routines in my daily life. In unforeseen circumstances though, I couldn't become consistent with it, and didn't keep up with it because of personal reasons I won't be delving into now... maybe next time in some other blog?</p>

      </div>
      <p> One of the skills that truly preoccupied around five minutes to hours of my daily life was touch-typing. I picked up the skill before the start of my first semester in college. At first, it was truly daunting and slow, I couldn't even construct words that fast. Long story short though, several months later, I was testing my speed on different websites like <a href="https://www.typeracer.com" target="_blank">typeracer.com</a> or even in <a href="https://www.monkeytpe.com" target="_blank">monkeytype.com</a>. It became one of the skills that helped me doing work and improved my productivity in general. </p>
      <p> Another relatively useful skill that to have for myself was learning how to code or program. So I watched videos about it at first, and then took some online courses about python c, and, html. I know it's a random combination of languages to start learning, but I just wanted to have a grasp on how developing things work. It was really fun getting to know how one should code your own apps/programs and having to experience doing it really felt like these skills I've taken in will be helpful for my future.</p>
      <p> What I picked up from learning various skills is that, you'll never really know when you when you're actually interested in something if you don't try it.</p>

      <h2> THE BAD </h2>
      <h3> @ Home </h3>
      <p> Staying and/or working at home feels like a luxury when I kept thinking about it back in my junior years. It was like a dream come true to me if it were to happen, and I truly believed that myself, but in reality dealing with both personal and work life at home is really hard. In addition to this I feel as if I'm really disconnected from the world right now than I've ever been before. I have been way more secluded with social connections outside of where I live, but I actually feel very fortunate that I have my family and relatives around my vicinity.</p>
      <h3> Mental well-being </h3>
      <p> Being solitary and feeling isolated has its own drawbacks. Not seeing the world as a whole and for what it is made me feel lonely and feel like I'm stuck in this confined space we call home. Honestly thinking about these kinds of stuff just keeps adding to my anxiety more and more. In my case, I feel like I don't properly live out my solitary lifestyle, that it has led me to various mental problems. My addiction for games and media keeps getting worse, and I keep trying to fight it on my own, even though I know inside of myself that I just need to speak up to someone for help.</p>
      <p> The way I cope with these problems are with the use of music, self-help videos online, video games, and media consumption. The first two of which are actually helpful, and the latter two acts as a deterrent for my mental being. Let's just say that you, the reader, won't have to worry about me with this problem because I know that I can get through this eventually.

      <h2> MY VERDICT</h2>
      <p> Man! It's been around two years now huh? and we're almost at the end of the year again staying strong. All I could say is that this past couple years wasn't pleasant, surprising isn't it? Although, if someone were to give me a chance and ask me if I wanted a redo of everything <i>COVID-19</i> has done to us, I would probably and most likely, pass up the opportunity. I'm not saying this as means to be "THAT" guy, but what I'm trying to say is that, all of our mixed experiences with our situation right now is a part of us. We've failed, struggled, gotten hurt, got up, then fell down again, but in the end, we've put all that behind us, things happen like this, though not all the time. Everything's going to be okay from this point on, because after we faced our hardships, a light out there is sure to come find you, you know? We will surely learn and grow from these experiences.</p>
      <p> A lot of people were given the time off from their primary obligations. Instead of constantly working and fulfilling our social lives, we were forced in a way to take time to ourselves. I had time to really evaluate my current situation, my plans, to gather energy, and to chase my long-term and spontaneous interests. Maybe I should try keeping myself this way of self-reflection beyond lockdown. The “new normal” might probably turn out slightly more nurturing and refreshing than the old one.</p>
      <p> I will remember this crisis of ours that we faced together. It's a surreal feeling: masked people everywhere, closed school campuses, etc. But it feels like we've improved our solidarity as a community.
