        <p>Welcome to my game-review website! This is certainly the first time I get to review games I've played. Currently, I don't play as much games as I used to because I've focused my life on other things. Though not entirely true, I've at least put less priority to games. I'm also that guy who watches YouTubers play their games more than I do my own. And, that is probably why you'll see me showcase games that are very somewhat commonly played. I wish I could put in some of my other more influential games, but this list still checks out.</p>
        <br><p>I'd like to keep this short so we can get to the content faster. So, below is my chosen five games I chose to showcase in no order at all!</p>

                <h3>Genshin what?</h3>
                <blockquote cite="Wikipedia">Genshin Impact is an action role-playing game developed by Chinese developer miHoYo, and first published in 2020. The game features an anime style open-world environment and an action-based battle system using elemental magic and character-switching</blockquote>
                <p>The game starts progressing its story travelling along with Paimon and learning about the world to find your 'lost' sibling and reunite together. Talking together with Paimon, you learn that there are seven who rule over the world with their godly powers called Archons (Anemo, Geo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Dendro, Cryo), in which it appears that talking to them might give you answers that can lead you closer to your goal. The whole plot of the game seem to revolve around this concept.</p>
                <p>This action-based open-world game lets you play with a party of four characters that you can change anytime. There are definitely challenges, quests, loots and chests that you can find around the map during your exploration, so that you can earn various rewards that range from decent to really good ones such as gold, exp, equipment, etc. which lets you enhance your characters. Doing these things gives you experience and a sense of progression through what's known as the Adventurer Level. While on the topic of adventuring, this open-world game allows you to traverse by means of running, climbing, swimming, sailing, etc. Then when you encounter enemies like <i>hilichurls</i> or abyss mages, you'd want to utilize the seven elements to your advantage. Since the game revolves around these seven elements, you can mix and match certain types of different characters to make elemental reactions which creates these powerful effects against your enemies. But also beware of the enemies that can use these against you. These element mixing aspect of the game, while not new, is what separates it from a similar title "The Legend of Zelda".</p>

            <div class="item-game-mythoughts">
                <h3>My thoughts</h3>
                <p>Genshin Impact is undoubtedly one of the most popular games you can play today, that is available on almost any gaming platform. Currently, it boasts around 50 million average monthly players. It also has a good reception with many awards coming from the likes of Apple's "iPhone's Game of the Year 2020", Google Play's "Users' Choice Game 2020", TapTap game award "Game of the Year", "The Game Awards 2021" and a couple others. This was an exceptional hit on the year 2020, but does it still hold true? Spoilers though, yes it still is.</p>            
                <p>As I first played it, I really noticed how wonderfully and carefully crafted the soundtracks are in this game, together with the gorgeous sceneries you could view while exploring different landscapes that matches the music. Combining those two elements together brings an immersive experience, and let me just say that mihoYo does it very well. Enkanomiya, the newest playable area, is a silent and desolate underground cave. It's empty yet one of the most visually pleasing areas you could hope to explore. This is accompanied by the melacholic music which provides a cold and relaxing feeling. It just captivates me to know more of its history and explore the scene.
                <!-- <br><small><i>p.s. If you want to learn more about the music, I highly suggest listening to the work of Yu-Peng Chen & HOYO-MiX. Maybe something like "Lovers' Oath" can show you just how powerful and emotional their soundtracks can be.</i></small> -->
                <!-- <div class="images"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YQr6frD.png" alt="Enkanomiya"></div> -->
                <div class="images"><img src="images/enkanomiya.png" alt="Enkanomiya"></div>
                <p>The story in Genshin starts off very slow, but the more you play it, the more you sense an overarching plot building up. As you progress, the world you know keeps expanding, but is limited by the version's current content you are playing on. This is because a lot of G.I. players who are caught up in the storyline knows about having no content to play with except for the time-limited events. As of right now, the developers have yet to give us a concrete roadmap of what's to come in the future for this game.</p>
                <p>The game offers you a lot of features right of the bat, without you needing to pay anything for it. The story, the gameplay, the challenge, the soundtracks, it's all there. Everything is for the most part free, and you wouldn't "need" to spend a single dime on this game to thoroughly enjoy it. Although, there are other means, I mean this isn't one of the most highest grossing games out there from nothing. What I'm talking about is the 'gacha' element, wherein you'd be the type of person to embrace its fact, or that it pushes you away from this game. What it essentially means is that, some game elements like "wishing" to get certain characters or weapons that will require some luck to get. The higher the rarity the lower chance you can get the character. You could possibly accept the fact by not expecting to get everything the game has to offer, and by then you'll be enjoying the game way more.</p>
                <p>To wrap things up, there are definitely more to love about this game than what I have just said in this review like the design of the playable characters and their story, or the fun events it has. For a supposed 'mobile game', it sets a higher standard for these games, and I think that's a good thing. Genshin Impact is a game you should be aware of, and it will continue like that for years to come. I really recommend this game for anyone looking to just play anything in general.</p>

                <h3>League of what?</h3>
                <blockquote cite="Wikipedia">League of Legends, commonly referred to as League, is a 2009 multiplayer online battle arena video game developed and published by Riot Games. Inspired by Defense of the Ancients, a custom map for Warcraft III, Riot's founders sought to develop a stand-alone game in the same genre.</blockquote>
                <p>Starting the game in the Summoner's Rift, you, the Summonner, are required to choose a champion based on the game's pool of champions, may it be the ones you own or the ones in the rotation. Players are then grouped together into two even teams that is made up of five members. Each team begins at the opposite sides of the map, where they can protect their base or "Nexus". To win the game, simply put, you have to destroy the opposing side's Nexus. Sounds easy, but it gets competitive by having turrets, minions and enemy champions that you have to pass through. The action happens on the three lanes where the players fight. In between these lanes, there's a jungle where monsters also spawn to grant you buffs or experience. Objectives are carried out by taking minion last hits, the huge monsters like the 'dragon', 'rift herald', or 'Baron', and then also taking the enemy turrets until you reach the other side. Doing so will give you advantage over your enemies in terms of gold that can buy you more powerful items to also potentially help you get through the enemy players.</p>

            <div class="item-game-mythoughts">
                <h3>My thoughts</h3>
                <p>League of Legends is a relatively old game spanning over 10 years worth of patches and changes, but you get the gist. This game is still fun and a competitive MOBA game, and that's what makes it addicting. There are tons of champions you can play as, with each having their different builds. On the earlier seasons of the game, you can have off-meta builds for different champions, but now you can only have a better time in the game following other people's "META" builds. In that way, there little to no variety in how builds work for certain champions. But that's still tolerable because, at the end of the day, it's still a team-based game, and your chances of winning depends on the composition of your team against the enemy's.</p>
                <p>In terms of gameplay, compared to DoTA/ Dota 2, it feels way more fast paced and responsive. In addition, it feels way faster to end the game, generally speaking, around 20-40 minutes of gameplay on average. League also has a simpler UI and game mechanics compared to that of Dota 2, which has a steeper learning curve. Since, it's commonly 5v5 you can invite up to four other friends to play with, if you have friends, and it makes the game overall more fun to play.</p>
                <p>The moment you start getting used to the ropes, the more you'd feel like you want to improve. Starting out, you feel comfortable playing casually, but there's also a way to test your skills in ranked games. And then you enter the competitive scene, where you rank up the ladders to higher ranks and show off as a badge of your hard earned work (unless your bronze and below cuz that isn't a rank to be proud of). Although simple, grinding through ranked games is very hard if you don't have friends you can trust to play with. As solo queuing is a hurdle in and of itself. From my experience, I started playing since mid season 4, but I never really took ranked seriously so I don't have much to say about that.</p>
                <div class="images"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/0UXHVwI.png" alt="LoL's rank tiers"></div>
                <p>Overall, League of Legends is still one of the most available games whenever you just want to kill some time or play competitively wherever you are as long as you have a PC and an internet. This game for me, is best played casually with friends, because that's what I have been doing for almost all of my games. The pros and cons that I will be listing will vary depending from person to person, because to each their own in this game.</p>

                <blockquote cite="Wikipedia">Valorant is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows.</blockquote>
                <p>Its game is a 5v5 Players start off their rounds in a "buy phase", wherein the players get to choose what to buy as their weapons or agent-specific utilities. Each team gets credits by winning a round, doing objectives, eliminating an enemy etc. Its default point system for the "unrated" or "competitive" game mode is a first-to-13 wins format, and with other game modes having shorter game time. The game has two sides, the "Attackers", who plants the 'spike', something close to a bomb, to one of the designated sites (2-3) which the "Defenders" try to secure. The attackers win not by planting the spike, but by eliminating all of the Defenders or until the bomb detonates. The Defenders, on the other hand, win by having enemies miss the chance to plant the spike in the given time, defusing the spike to prevent it from detonating, or eliminating all the opposing players.</p>
                <p>What sets is apart from CS is that Valorant offers the presence of unique agents per player. These agents possess unique abilites or gadgets of their own to help them in fighting. Each team consists of their different agents, whom can be classified into the categories of: Duelists, Initiators, Sentinels, and Controllers; with each having their own playstyles or role for the team.</p>

                <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Valorant is a game I played during its launch after beta. Since I was into CS:GO before playing this, I had, for the most part, experience that helped me understand the fundamentals of how Valorant is played. Basically, no sprinting movements, you run faster with your knife out, and you also need to stop before you shoot to be accurate. Throw into these agents with abilites that offer tactical utilities (except for Raze) then BAM! you have Valorant.</p>
                <p>Valorant has its own style when it comes to its design and how its portrayed. You know, the look of non-photorealistic, cartoony, and 2D flat style. Just by looking at it for the first time, it's one of the things you'll definitely notice. Making a quick search on the internet, I found out that it's a stylized art called 'cel shading'. It's really a plus thing to have that because you see it having a sense of identity and uniqueness. Compare that to CS:GO that has a realistic, and desaturated feel.</p>
                <p>Its gunplay is one of the most satisfying aspects that will hook you into the game. Just the feeling of getting multi-kills or landing unbelievable headshots gives you a rush. It's also that moment where you or your teammates scream after a successful 'big-brain' or 'high-IQ' play. Add also the the game's high skill ceiling, which really make this game that much addicting. Since this game is still reIatively new, its esports scene has yet to create larger waves, and I'm looking forward to see more plays made by professionals in the future.</p>
                <p>This game is by far, an easier version of Counter-Strike... a toned-down yet still fun version at that. Is that a good thing? Well, yes and no. Valve's CS already offers one of the beloved FPS titles out there, and Riot taking inspiration from it is a good move because it inherits the good things from CS and then expands upon using its own quirks. Its like taking a working formula and thinking of another way to go about it. Its great to have competition, because before Valorant, CS was the only title that offered clean and precise gunplay, and right now, both games seem to be improving in their own rights.</p>
                <p>In the end, I think that Valorant is a fantastic game, albeit very competitive and becomes toxic very quickly if you talk smack. In my opinion, when I play ranked games, Valorant becomes perpetually stress-inducing and less fun. So yeah, I used to play this seriously but now I'm very lax and casual about it, and only play this when my friends invite me out or I invite them, which happens only on rare occasions. </p>

                <h3>MINECRAFT?!</h3>
                <blockquote cite="Wikipedia">Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following several early private testing versions, it was first made public in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens "Jeb" Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video game of all time, with over 238 million copies sold and nearly 140 million monthly active users as of 2021.</blockquote>
                <p>Explore the world and use building blocks in the game to creatively customize your own world to create nearly anything you can imagine. May it be harvesting resources and fighting off monsters on your survival world or building your own skyscrapers or medieval-themed villages. In Minecraft, you have your own story to create and interact with.</p>

            <div class="item-game-mythoughts">
                <h3>My Thoughts</h3>
                <p>Minecraft, the critically acclaimed godfather of all blocky games, is still very popular among people of all ages. The only enjoyment you get comes from how much time you pour in this game playing it, and that's saying a lot. The name of the game is freedom here, where you'll define what you want to do with the game.</p>
                <p>When I was a kid, I used to watch Minecraft content creators such as SkyDoesMinecraft or SSundee. I was a huge fan of their Role-Playing games together. It inspired me to play the game as well, but I didn't have the device to play nor the resources to play it at the time. Even though I wasn't playing the game, the enjoyment and positive experience I got from Minecraft let's players is very special to me. As time passed, I got into Minecraft Pocket Edition, where I played my very own first survival world. Building my own house from limited materials was a tough challenge and also a rewarding one. Fast forward onto my older years, I played this game on PC along with some of my friends in a server, because adventuring together is always more fun than being alone. The more packed it was in our server, the crazier the experience.</p>
                <p>Minecraft's worlds are all procedurally generated using a set of numbers called seeds. Each time you create a world, it will be different from the next. This is a great way to make each person's experience different from the next. In these worlds you play in have different biomes and interesting areas to explore. I find myself being mesmerized by the gorgeous extreme mountains, and also get lost on deep dark caverns. The exploration aspect helps you gain different materials you can use for crafting inventions to help you with stuff, to upgrade your equipment, or to build your own structures of a distinct type of material, because some things are just not that easy to obtain. I like exploring through the wielderness and going out on an uunplanned expedition foraging through different landscapes. One day, I could be stuck in the mines trying to mine and craft my way out, and chopping trees the next. It's the thrill I seek, and the sense of adventure I feel doing this.</p>
                <p>If you don't like the survival aspect of this game, there's always the Creative gamemode where you have no health, hunger, nor monsters to deal with. In this mode, you have all the freedom to build whatever it is you want to create to your hearts content. Build enormous castles or fortresses for all we care, it's all up to the builder's hands. I personally, don't use this mode that much because I'm not that creative meself. I sadly couldn't showcase my past builds as they aren't backed-up.</p>
                <p>Minecraft is unarguably still one of the best games out there. It is a huge timesink once you get into it and there are definitely more to Minecraft than what I just stated in my review, but I really recommend it to anyone looking for a game to spend their time with. My opinion in Minecraft is very different from other people also playing this game. Some don't generally like it, and some swear by it. I am most definitely somewhere in the middle of the pack. Minecraft might sound llke its for everybody to play, but there will most definitely be people out there who 6don't enjoy Minecraft the same way. </p>

                <h3>Hollow Knight</h3>
                <blockquote cite="Wikipedia">Hollow Knight is a 2017 Metroidvania action-adventure game developed and published by Team Cherry. It was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux in 2017, and for the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in 2018.</blockquote>
                <p>The world of Hollow Knight takes place in Hallow Nest. You, who play as the Knight, will venture your way through the different kingdoms and areas surrounding it.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="item-game-mythoughts">
                <h3>My thoughts</h3>
                <p>Hollow Knight is one of those games that I've seen being recommended a lot on the internet. I didn't really enjoy 2D games, but this one was different. Even though I have only been playing this game for around 10 hours, I can still say it holds a special place in my favorite games, that's how great the game is.</p>
                <p>Its story is very subtle and is something you will have to play in order to get a sense of its meaning. It's narrative relies on you exploring through the world without guidance, and you basically have to put the bits and pieces of information together. This aspect keeps surprising me because the more you progress the plot, the more you keep wanting more of it so you keep exploring the world scouring for information. </p>
                <p>The music and sound design are one of the best out there. Composed by Christopher Larkin, the music in this game is incredible, whether it's the ambient background music of a new area, or the intense, riveting theme of a difficult boss. In other areas, the sound design makes you feel pensive or anxious or nervous or dream-like. Whatever the game wants you to feel, you'll feel it because of the music and sound.</p>
                <p>Exploration is incredibly fun to do. Your sense of progression can be tangibly seen from your Knight because you can get upgrades, spells, and more skills when you manage to explore areas, hard-to-get-through places, or through defeating a boss. Your Knight won't feel the same as it was before you started playing it. Also unlocking and equipping different charms can dictate how you can play the game. When I'm exploring, the atmospheres in Hallow Nest mostly feels melancholic and empty, and sometimes really eerie. But when I see a small hint of life, in contrast to the barren places, I'd feel a sense of safety, an oasis. You'll find lots of these things I'm talking about when you sense how big the scale of the world is.</p>
                <div class="images"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mwldb63.png" alt="Butterflies surrounding the character"></div>
                <p>Its 'insect' style and aesthetic is one of my favorites as it is very consistent with the rest of the game. The theme from its menu to the NPC's you meet, are well-blended together.</p>
                <p>I expect a lot more from this game in the future as I have yet to scratch its surface. Honesly, the first time I played Hollow Knight, I felt frustrated and lost going through the world of Hallow Nest because there wasn't some quest line that I should be following, but then I decided to come back to it only to realize why I wasn't playing this early on. So yeah, this might not be for someone who don't have the patience, but other than that you should be playing it as well.</p>
